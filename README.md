# Gem Drop Collector
Description: A Chrome extension that will auto click the gem drop button on boxed.gg

How to install:
1. Download the ZIP of this repo's main branch.
2. Extract the folder into the directory of your choice.
3. In Chrome, open the extensions menu and turn on "developer mode".
4. Click "Load Unpacked", then find the folder you extracted. Select the subfolder "src".

How to use:
1. The extension should be enabled by default. You can turn it off by opening the popup (click the extension icon) and toggling the switch.
2. This extension (currently) only works if the following conditions are met:
    - The active window must be on boxed.gg.
    - You must be logged into your boxed.gg account.
    - You must have verified your identity in your account in order to be eligible for gem drops.
    - The chat window must be open at all times for the extension to see the gem drop button.

I am working on improving the extension when I have the time to do so. But for now, it works fine for me just sitting open on an idle computer and collecting gems at :58 of every hour. I'm probably going to put this on the extension store at some point but I'm very inexperienced so it might be a while before this is at a point where I'm comfortable doing so.

Feel free to try it out and submut issues to suggest any changes or features!
